# Project 3 - *Yelp Search*

**Yelp Search** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height. (3pt)
- [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints. (+5pt)
- [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does). (+2pt)

The following **stretch** features are implemented:

- [ ] Infinite scroll for restaurant results. (+3pt)
- [ ] Implement map view of restaurant results. (+3pt)
- [ ] Implement the restaurant detail page. (+2pt)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. how to clone and then push to other repo correctly.
2. how to find out and learn new functions while there is no tutorials. 

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

This is my first time to get the clone file and push to my repo which is a little different than create a new project.
The constrain tutorial is kind of confusing, because the version differences and it is hard to see the changes made.
